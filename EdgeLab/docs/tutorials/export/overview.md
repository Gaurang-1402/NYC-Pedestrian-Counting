# Model Export

EdgeLab currently supports the following methods to convert and export models. You can refer to the corresponding tutorials to complete the model export, and then put the exported model into deployment.

- [PyTorch to ONNX](./pytorch_2_onnx.md): Converts PyTorch model and `.pth` weights to ONNX model `.onnx`

- [PyTorch to TFLite](./pytorch_2_tflite.md): Converts PyTorch model and `.pth` weights to TFLite model `.tflite` 

::: tip

Before you can start exporting models, you need to complete the [Training](../training/overview) section and obtain model weights `.pth` file before start exporting.
